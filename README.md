# sanisettes

Sanisettes is a public little project on python to display a map and a gps path to the nearest public toilet in Paris

## Method 

Data has been extracted and treated from the open data of the city of Paris and RATP.
Folium has been used to create the map and the markers. The API route and directions from rapidapi has been used for the coordinates of the best path to use.

Just like Flush, there is the data of the accessibility for handi people. A map is also displaying in the notebook all of the toilets available in Paris and their accessibility too. 

## Discussion
This project has no intention of growing but for technical and curiosity purpose, it could be export to a Django or React application and display on web. 
There were no objective of optimizing the process of the data to lower the time of calculation. It could be the next achievement for this project.
